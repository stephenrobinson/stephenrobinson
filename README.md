The resources that I create are generally used for educational purposes although I may occasionally create programming tools and games


This project is related to Python and is a basic ASCII hangman game
Educational notes:  
- Python is generically a functional language.  
- Scope is difficult to teach as global variables in functions are read only and they become Out of Scope if values are assigned!
- Whilst the global keyword can be used but setting up functions to declare them takes some thought
>
>Programming considerations:  Strings are immutable so replacing a single chracter when a correct guess occurs is a bit of work. 
> 
- I have opted for using a list of chars
