The resources that I create are generally used for educational purposes although I may occasionally create programming tools and games


This project is related to Python and is a basic ASCII hangman game
> Educational notes:  
- Python is generically a functional language.

- Strings are immutable so replacing a single chracter when a correct guess occurs is a bit of work.  
  - I have opted for using a list of chars instead 
- Scope is difficult to teach as global variables are only in scope to read inside functions and they become Local Variables (and therefore out of scope) if values are assigned!
